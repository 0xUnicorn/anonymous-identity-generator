# Anonymous Identity Generator

[toc]

## Intro

Obfuscate your online identity using anonymous usernames/emails and generate them along with a password.

The concept is based on password managers, for remembering both complex passwords and usernames/emails.

Due to common restrictions on username length and characters, the primary method will be a md5 hash sliced in half.

For emails you would need a catch all address on your domain or a 3rd party provider like [SimpleLogin](https://simplelogin.io) or [AnonAddy](https://anonaddy.com) due to obvious reasons.
